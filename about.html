          This project was created as a part of a graduation project in
          communication design. It provides a tool that can be used to visualize
          music. The fusion between musical atmosphere, visual representation
          and figurative poetic language can be discovered and reinvented
          through improvisation and dialogue. The glossary below shows
          theoretical research and content on the topic.

          <h3>CHROMESTHESIA</h3>
          <p>
            Color changes how we feel. Sound transforms what we see. Smell
            determines what we taste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Synesthesia — the experience of one sense evoking another — is more
            common than we realize. While Performing music and designing visual
            we need to create the overlaps and intersections of the senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing colors, also known as chromesthesia, is one of the forms of
            "involuntary parallel sensations." Thereby, it is understood as
            being the sensation of colors as experienced by means of hearing
            acoustic tones and sounds. It involves subjective color-sound
            relationships. Corresponding to the aforementioned characteristics,
            these phenomena appear involuntarily among synesthetes. Every individual exhibits a unique scheme of allocation which
            remains constant and independent of the context of the perception
            throughout his or her entire life. Besides synesthetes, most people are able to spontaneously assign colors to an auditory event. They have corresponding analogy relations. However, this
            connection is not absolute. Instead, it experiences modifications
            depending on the perceptual situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The absolute connection of color perceptions with a certain tone or
            sound attribute, in the case of a color hearer, is comparable to the
            capabilities of hearing with perfect pitch. The tone pitch can be
            regarded as a visual-spatial attribute within the framework of
            cross-modal analogies. As a result, color perceptions arise among
            some people as a consequence of certain tone pitches and among
            others due to certain timbres, intervals, temporal structures, or
            other auditory attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chromesthesia could teach us to listen more detailed and look more
            closely to our environment. If sharpening our senses while listening
            to something auditive, people could realize that another's
            viewpoint, is equally true and real.

          <h3>COLOR <br /><span class="tab">& MUSICAL SCALES</span></h3>
          <p>
            Scientists and artists have always been researching color scales.
            When Isaac Newton projected light through a prism and discovered the
            color spectrum around 1665, he chose to slice the rainbow into seven
            basic hues, believing that color must be structured like the musical
            scale. Newton was so convinced that color and music were analogous,
            he added indigo to his color wheel to make his system a better match
            for music.*16
          </p>
          <p>
            In the seventeenth century, Aristotle already proposed a scale
            according to color brightness. This color scale made reference to
            seven equally spaced musical intervals - thus, not to tones, but to
            distances between the tones.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the latest, since the experiments of Louis-Bertrand Castel in
            the mid-eighteenth century, the classification of sound
            and color has been the subject of various research studies and
            artistic experiments. It is also obvious, however, that there is no
            conclusive, nearby solution which would exclusively orient itself
            with respect to the color tone and also be accepted by a majority of
            persons. Indeed, test subjects usually tend to classify colors on
            the basis of the color brightness - or saturation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is based upon the finding that typical colors exhibit a
            characteristic brightness, for example, which appears low in the
            case of blue, but with higher values in the case of yellow or white.
            An appropriate color scale leads approximately from black to white
            via blue, red, orange, and yellow. 23
          </p>
          <p>
            VIDI uses three different color schemes that can be selected before
            playing. These scales vary between light, soft colors and dark,
            strong colors. Within the color schemes, the intervals of the played
            tones are calculated and, depending on the musical harmony, similar
            or contrasting colors are shown to each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>CROSS-MODAL <br /><span class="tab">LANGUAGE</span></h3>
          <p>
            When we describe our visual and auditory perceptions through
            language, we often make use of adjectives and attributes that do not
            come from the practice we are describing. Examples of this in German
            are pitch [Tonhöhe] or timbre [Klangfarbe].
          </p>
          <p>
            Sound primes us to see. When a dog snarls or brakes screech, images
            rush to our minds. Musicians and audio engineers call a sound
            “bright” or “dull” depending on its overall frequency. The clash of
            a cymbal is considered wide and flat, while the voice of a flute is
            bright and sharp. Such terms assign visual and tactile qualities to
            sound.4 People with synesthesia link certain sensations in a
            consistent or systematic manner — as do people with more ordinary
            sensory responses. Metaphors such as “piercing cry,” “soft whisper,”
            or “coarse language” assign tactile characteristics to sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            „The colors of music are concrete and vivid – most spoken voices and
            individual sounds are as elusive as smoke.“
          </p>
          <p>
            „I could tell that I perceive colors as tasting like toothpaste or
            biting like acid“
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to describe sensations as elements which give rise to
            complex models of the perceived, these must be designated as
            perceptual characteristics or qualities. *20
          </p>
          <p>
            By using non-restrictive language or open-ended attributes, VIDI can
            keep the playing field more open and creative for musicians and
            performers, rather than having to choose a specific genre.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>DESIGN</h3>
          <p>
            Design is often evaluated as qualitative if it is reduced and
            timeless. In contrast to music, there are few examples in design
            where the design gains quality through the emotionality shown by the
            designer. Most design is caged by the image. We “look” at design, we
            don't “feel,” “experience,” or “sense” it. In fact, most design is
            non-sense design — cold, technical, formal, and inhuman — engineered
            to serve business or technical functions rather than to surprise,
            inspire, and delight. We have allowed two of our sensory domains —
            sight and sound — to dominate our design imagination. In fact, when
            it comes to the culture of architecture and design, we create and
            produce almost exclusively for one sense— the visual. *4
          </p>
          <p>
            The creation of design is also often practiced in a very linear and
            goal-oriented manner. From the first sketch and subsequent drafts
            often follows a result to the conclusion. What about the process,
            intuition and improvisation? Also, the collaboration of designers is
            often rather limited to the individual. We don't show off our
            designs but brag about our final products. Even the software we use
            to design is tailored to individuals. Working together on a file
            still remains unresolved. We sit in front of our computers and
            engage in painstaking pixel-shifting when editing moving images.
          </p>
          <p>
            VIDI thinks about a more immediate practice of design and puts the
            moment of creation and perception at eye level. We think that it's
            good for graphic designers to be inspired by sources that come from
            somewhere else.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>EMOTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            We link music, as well as colors very strongly with our perceptions
            and memories. A song can change our feelings and a color can
            influence us. The musical long-term memory can be seen as a mentally
            represented "music library". *3
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain colors can also trigger negative as well as positive
            feelings in us. We describe colors as "friendly" or "aggressive" and
            thus interpret human feelings into them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuroscience tells us that we are emotional decision makers, not
            rational spreadsheets. Most of our decisions are made live — in real
            time without our awareness. Let's use the language of passion to
            translate the intellectual into the emotional.*7
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>GESTURE</h3>
          <p>
            The gesture of the analog has changed enormously to the gesture of
            the digital. Especially for music: Digital music lacks the tangible
            ressonance of analog instruments. The vibration of analog sound
            production is diminishing and we observe musicians pressing keys in
            front of computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            VIDI uses the computer as a visual and musical instrument and
            supports the gesture of playing music. Midi signals are recognized
            by VIDI and translated into moving color dots.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>IMPROVISATION</h3>
          <p>
            Design may well learn from music. Improvising and jamming can
            function between musicians like a self-developed language. The trial
            and error and unplanned creative process creates great moments of
            exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            When using VIDI, the visual output can certainly influence musical
            development and it gives the opportunity to get inspired during
            creation or improvisation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>LIVENESS</h3>
          <p>
            Immediate Media: Most of the media we consume is fast and works
            anywhere, anytime. One might think that we consume design live, yet
            most of the design we absorb is staged and planned to the second.
            Perceiving visual design live, the second it is created, perhaps
            holds new possibilities?
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to design the design process to open the medium for full
            immersive experience. Live experience has the bandwidth of reality —
            it is fully immersive, and the visitor's body and mind are alive and
            available for full engagement of all the senses. *5
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>MOVEMENT,<br /><span class="tab">TIME & SPACE</span></h3>
          <p>
            Movement shows speed, spatial presence and dynamics. While music
            works intuitively with movement in the process of creation and the
            moment of perception, design often has a hard time with it. Often
            the only movement that design demands is the direction of the gaze
            on what is designed. Can't the visual challenge us in our physical
            movement just like music? Let's design for our sense of movement.
            After all, our visitors are not static viewpoints. *11
          </p>
          <p>
            VIDI plays with the commonalities of visual and musical practice:
            Movement, Time & Space
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>MUSIC</h3>
          <p>
            Music is the consciously designed, temporally structured ordering of
            acoustic events in social contexts. Music is therefore, along with
            language, a second human-specific, intraspecific phonetic
            communication system that establishes social bonds and generates
            emotions.*1 Music perception is based on a complex interplay of
            processing melodic, temporal, harmonic, and dynamic structures. *2
          </p>
          <p>
            When we speak of music theory, strictly speaking, we are not talking
            about a theory, but more about a fixed system of order. This system
            helps us to distinguish and explain harmonic and disharmonic sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            VIDI uses the approaches of the tone dependencies to each other to
            assign color contrasts to each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h3>MULTISENSORIAL <br /><span class="tab">PERCEPTION</span></h3>
          <p>
            In multisensory connections, the particular proximity of
            spatial-visual and spectral-auditory attributes is striking-for
            example, the preferential perceptual connection between visual
            height and auditory pitch. The perception of sound is more strongly
            influenced by the brightness and color saturation of simultaneously
            presented visual stimuli than by hue itself. Unpleasant or
            frightening sounds exert less influence when accompanied by
            brightness and saturation *23
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers sought to discover possible systematic relationships
            between sound qualities and visual forms. Again, no self-evident
            solutions can be found that would seem intuitive to many people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Music notation is an important, traditional application of the
            analogy between pitch and visual form. In currently established
            notation, pitch corresponds to the spatial arrangement of notes on
            the vertical axis, while time corresponds to movement on the
            horizontal axis. The transformation of time corresponds to the
            direction of writing from left to right. Efforts to translate
            auditory perceptual events into the visual sphere are often based on
            this scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
            VIDI uses the translation of tonal qualities, such as volume, pitch,
            and type of play, into visual analogs such as scalability,
            saturation, and visual appearance and disappearance.
          </p>

          <h3>SYNTHESIS</h3>
          <p>
            Multi-sensorial Design: Human communication constantly mixes sound
            and vision.Typography is multisensory — it is audio and visual,
            sound and symbol. Speech is haptic and gestural as well as aural,
            felt in the muscles of the face, throat, and mouth. Writing is
            gesture. The sign languages created by deaf communities are fully
            functioning linguistic systems, designed for seeing not hearing.
            Studying sound through visual or tactile means is a powerful method
            of invention.Visualization offers a rich path for experiencing sound
            beyond the audible. Graphic interpretations of sound illuminate
            patterns and structure and generate new memories and associations.
            Communication that bridges our different senses helps connect us to
            each other and to the physical world. *19
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to understand and synthesize complex, diverse inputs
            across many disciplines into one compelling, immersive experience is

            If we are to develop an all-senses design method, we will need to
            consciously focus on the senses and build a process of synthesis.*6
            Design for each of the senses then synthesize. Think of each sense
            as a track in a complex polyphonic composition. *9

            Using VIDI to not only gives the possibility to create a synthesis
            between auditive and visual, it also proposes to use the generated
            visual as a projected light into the spacial. The synthesis is even
            more evident through the audio and light waves carried over the air.

          <h3>VISUALISING</h3>
          <p>
            Music visualizations are commonplace at clubs or concerts, where
            screen graphics pulse with frantic energy. Within the framework of
            multimedia applications, it is interesting to create visual
            structures which correspond as plausibly as possible to given sounds
            and music passages.

            Today, lighting, film, and computers offer various possibilities of
            realization. Simultaneously, the video provides broad possibilities
            of visualization - ranging from the presentation of moving abstract
            forms to the interpretation of the music in specific scenes and
            storylines. Thereby, nonetheless, uncommitted approaches are
            preferred, instead of seeking to establish a theoretical foundation
            of the multimedia production and to systematically assigning colors
            and forms to certain elements of the music.

            In the course of scientific and industrial development, there was
            increased interest in visualizing music. There are numerous examples
            of audio-visual connections as designed for the arts and music. The
            technical possibilities of artistic configuration have been
            significantly expanded by virtue of lasers, cybernetics,
            electronics, and computers. A new dimension was reached with the
            vast possibilities of interactivity, thus blurring the traditional
            border between the active, formative artist and the inactive, simply
            perceiving recipient. While the technical realization of multimedia
            applications was increasingly made possible, the readiness to
            determine systematic assignments between tones, sounds and colors,
            however, has declined over the course of the twentieth century.
            Systematic concepts have made way for greater creative freedom and
            emotionality. *30

            VIDI gives smaller artists, who can't afford a light show, the
            possibility to generate visual imagery personalized to their music
            and creates a contrast to prefabricated VJ settings.
